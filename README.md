# Dockerized Rails and React Example

This is an example of a Dockerized application development environment for React running in parallel with a Ruby on Rails back-end. This is a development environment only, **not** an example of a production environment (see the FAQ for details).

This is a demonstration of how to create and setup a common developer environment for different programming languages without having to install those languages on your computer. Everything is provided by Docker containers.

In this document I'll walk you step-by-step through how to setup a Docker Compose file to create your React and Rails applications using only Docker. No installation of Ruby or Node on your host machine will be required.

**Requirements:**

To follow the directions you need to have the following installed:

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed (I won't walk you through installing Docker,
[the Docker website](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) has the directions you'll need for your OS)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or another IDE or text editor (including vim or emacs)

There are some subtle differences with how Docker works on Windows, MacOS and Linux. I'll try to point out extra steps necessary depending on your OS version whenever necessary. Docker makes it possible to create common developer environments without having to depend on the host operating system!

## Getting Started

Docker containers can be created and run from the command-line quite easily but we're going to be running an entire environment. To manage multiple containers for a single application we can use a Docker feature called [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). Docker Compose makes it much easier to manage multiple containers and the mapping of folders and also the networking between containers.

Docker Compose is managed through a [YAML](https://yaml.org/) file called `docker-compose.yml`. So lets begin with that.

### Step 1: Create a docker-compose.yml file

In the directory you'll be working in create a file called `docker-compose.yml` and fill it with the following:

```yml
services:
  frontend:
    image: node:18.8.0-bullseye
    restart: "no"
    volumes:
      - ./frontend:/app
```

In this file we have described one container named `frontend` that will be running Node v18 on Debian Bullseye. It won't restart. It maps a folder "volume" from the `/app` folder on the container to `./frontend` from the working folder on the host machine.

Now when we can use `create-react-app` to create our frontend React framework by running a command on the container and the volume mapping will save the files to our host machine:


```sh
docker compose run frontend yarn create react-app app --template typescript
```

**A few things are going to happen now!**

1. Docker will download the Node 18 image layers from Docker Hub to your host computer.
2. Docker Compose will start a container named "frontend" using the image it just downloaded with the folder mapping `/frontend` to `/app`
3. Docker will *run* on "frontend" the `yarn create react-app` command into the `/app` folder on the container using the Typescript template.
4. Because Docker mapped `/app` to `./frontend` Docker will create the `frontend` folder and when `create-react-app` finishes the React application will also be in that folder on the host machine.
5. When `create-react-app` completes Docker will stop the "frontend" container.

All of these steps took a little over 10 minutes on my computer so don't be worried if it takes a while.

### Step 2: Create a Docker Image for Frontend

In the newly created `frontend` folder we need to create a `Dockerfile` that will let us create the React frontend over-and-over and to run the app when we start the app.

Create `Dockerfile` in the `frontend` folder. Put the following contents in:

```Dockerfile
FROM node:18.8.0-bullseye

RUN mkdir /app
WORKDIR /app

EXPOSE 3000
```

The Dockerfile will use the same `image` we used from the `docker-compose` file (node:18.8.0-bullseye) as a base, but will use `/app` for the directory to run commands in. It also will `EXPOSE` port 3000, the default for the `create-react-app` server.

Now lets edit the `docker-compose.yml` file so that it will use the Dockerfile to create the app image instead of the raw Node:18-bullseye image:

```yml
version: "3.8"
services:
  frontend:
    build:
      context: ./frontend
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    command: yarn start
    restart: "no"
    volumes:
      - ./frontend:/app
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"

```

So by replacing the `image` section with a `build` section we've changed "frontend" from using an `image` to a built Dockerfile.

We've also added a `command` that will run `yarn start` starting the React development server.

Finally we mapped `ports` from `3000` on the container to `4000` on the host server. We can use Docker networking to map a container port to an entirely different port on the host. This is useful when you're running more than one service. For example in future steps we'll create a Rails app and Rails also likes to default to port 3000.

Now we can start the React server now using the following command:

```sh
docker compose up
```

After the React server is running you will be able to use your web browser to go to http://localhost:4000/ and you should see the Create React App default page.

At this point we have demonstrated how to use Docker to create a Node/React application without having to install any programming languages. How exciting! ðŸ¥³ You can fire up your code editor to edit directly from the host filesystem or open in the container using VS Code remoting or WebStorm.

Before we go to the next step lets stop our current Docker services:

```sh
docker compose down
```

## Step 3: Create the Rails Backend

Now we are going to build on our working frontend to add our backend service.

To make it a little more challenging we'll create our Rails application to use Postgres and Redis. This will make it closer to what you'd likely run in production but more importantly it will show just how easy it is to add services using Docker Compose!

I'll start with the easy part: the Postgres and Redis services. These are database services and they'll have data we need to keep around after we do things like restart our computers. That means we'll need persistent volumes for them.

### Step 3a: Add Postgres and Redis services

Lets add the following snippet to our `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yml
version: "3.8"
services:
  frontend:
    build:
      context: ./frontend
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    command: yarn start
    restart: "no"
    volumes:
      - ./frontend:/app
    ports:
      - "4000:3000"
  postgres:
    image: postgres:12.11-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: _Password123!
    volumes:
      - postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data:rw
  redis:
    image: redis:7.0-alpine
    volumes:
      - redis-data:/data:rw
volumes:
  postgres-data:
  redis-data:

```

You'll note that we've added the `volume` mapping for the databases. Docker always uses the notation of `host:container`. In this example we're creating two *Docker managed volumes* called `postgres-data` and `redis-data` in the `volumes` section. In the frontend section we wanted to map the sourcecode to a folder. For the database services we're not as worried about where the data should go so we'll let Docker create manage the volumes on its own.

You've probably also noticed the `environment` section for the `postgres` service. In keeping with the [12 Factor App](https://12factor.net/config) both Docker and Postgres allow passing configuration settings through environment variables. The [Postgres Docker image requires we create a database with a password](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/) and that is done with the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` environment variable.

> Right now `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` is not a safe or secure password, even for a development environment. I'll show you how to configure it better soon.

To test the setting lets start Docker again:

```sh
docker compose up
```

This may take a little while again as Docker pulls images for Postgres and Redis from the Docker Hub. You will know things are ready when you see in the console output:


```
docker-rails-react-postgres-1  | 2022-01-01 00:00:00.000 UTC [1] LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections
```

and

```
docker-rails-react-redis-1     | 1:M 01 Jan 2022 00:00:00.000 * Ready to accept connections
```

If both services are "ready to accept connections" we are ready to proceed. Use `CTRL-C` to stop docker and run `docker compose down` to stop the services again.

## FAQ

### Why no example of a production environment?

It is easy to use Docker in production using lots of cloud servers or your own
local computers! You'll make different choices about databases and edge servers
than we do for development. Also there will be different choices for how you
would handle things like secrets managements, cloud databases, etc.

This example is for getting a development team up, and collaborating fast!
